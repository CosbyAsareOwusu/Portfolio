### 📊 Project 1: Supplier Sustainability Analysis for Palmico  
**Tools:** Power BI  
**Focus:** Supply Chain Sustainability & Data Visualization  

**Summary:**  
Analyzed supplier contributions to Palmico’s deforestation-free (green) score. Built an interactive dashboard using Power BI to evaluate the volume of palm oil supplied by each direct supplier, and the extent to which their practices support sustainability goals.

**Key Insights:**
- Supplier G had the highest contribution to deforestation-free score (12,284.56 MT).  
- Malaysia was the top producer of sustainable palm oil, followed by Indonesia.  
- Supplier C delivered 100% deforestation-free oil; Supplier E had the highest overall volume.  
- Identified data gaps in supplier scoring (green/yellow/red) that affected reporting accuracy.  

**Outcome:**  
Recommended strategic sourcing from Supplier G and other top green-rated suppliers. Enabled sustainability decision-making through visual and data-driven insights.
