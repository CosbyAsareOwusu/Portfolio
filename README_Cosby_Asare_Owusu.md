### ðŸ“Š Project 1: Supplier Sustainability Analysis for Palmico
**Tools:** Power BI  
**Focus:** Supply Chain Sustainability & Data Visualization

**Summary:**  
Analyzed supplier contributions to Palmicoâ€™s deforestation-free (green) score. Built an interactive dashboard using Power BI to evaluate the volume of palm oil supplied by each direct supplier, and the extent to which their practices support sustainability goals.

**Key Insights:**
- Supplier G had the highest contribution to deforestation-free score (12,284.56 MT).
- Malaysia was the top producer of sustainable palm oil, followed by Indonesia.
- Supplier C delivered 100% deforestation-free oil; Supplier E had the highest overall volume.
- Noted discrepancies in supplier scoring (green/yellow/red) due to incomplete data summation.

**Outcome:**  
Recommended strategic sourcing from Supplier G and other top green-rated suppliers. Enabled decision-making on sustainable sourcing through visual and data-driven insights.
